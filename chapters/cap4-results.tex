\chapter{Results}\label{sec:cap4}

This chapter presents the results obtained from the implemented models, including their performance metrics and comparisons. The models are evaluated based on their ability to detect anomalies in the discharge data and the lead time they provide before a disruption occurs.

\section{GitHub Organization}

This project uses \todo{siglas} GIT to handle different versions. As multiple software has been developed in this project, a GitHub Organization has been created in order to ease the cloning process.

The main repositories available on the organization are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outlier orchestrator:} This repository contains the orchestrator explained at \autoref{sec:orchestrator}. 
\end{itemize}
