  abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been extensively studied and have shown remarkable success in many applications. However the success of SVM is very limited when it is applied to the problem of learning from imbalanced datasets in which negative instances heavily outnumber the positive instances (e.g. in gene profiling and detecting credit card fraud). This paper discusses the factors behind this failure and explains why the common strategy of undersampling the training data may not be the best choice for SVM. We then propose an algorithm for overcoming these problems which is based on a variant of the SMOTE algorithm by Chawla et al, combined with Veropoulos et al's different error costs algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm against these two algorithms, along with undersampling and regular SVM and show that our algorithm outperforms all of them.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on the development of a data driven model, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the real-time detection of disruptive events at JET. The predictor exploits the ability of CNNs in learning relevant spatiotemporal information straight from 1D plasma profiles, avoiding hand-engineered feature extraction procedures. In this paper, the radiation profiles from both the bolometer horizontal and vertical cameras have been considered amongst the predictor inputs, with the aim of discriminating between the core radiation due to impurity accumulations and the outboard radiation phenomena. Moreover, an innovative predictor architecture is proposed, where two separate CNNs are trained to focus on events with different timescales, that is, the destabilization of radiation, electron density and temperature profiles, and the mode-locking and current profile variations. The outputs of the two CNNs are combined with a logic OR function to provide the disruption alarm trigger. The advantages of this data fusion approach impact on the predictor performance, with a very limited number of false alarms (only 1 in the considered test set), and on the model output interpretability as the two different branches are triggered by different types of events.}

  abstract = {The present research focuses on investigating deep neural networks techniques for predicting plasma disruptions in tokamaks. For this purpose, various deep-learning predictive models and several plasma diagnostics will be analyzed, using data gathered during the experimental campaigns conducted at the JET nuclear fusion tokamak between 2011 and 2020. The primary objective of this study is to show that the contribution of the MHD spectrograms increases the disruption predictor performance. The final deep-learning prediction model leverages the capability of Convolutional Neural Networks to directly learn important spatiotemporal information from 1D plasma profiles of temperature, density and power radiation, obtained from High Resolution Thomson Scattering and Bolometer diagnostics, as well as from spectrograms generated by a set of fast magnetic pick-up coils known as Mirnov coils. The Convolutional Neural Network eliminates the need for manual feature extraction methods that characterize the majority of machine learning methods. Using plasma profiles information allows to distinguish between core radiation caused by impurity accumulations and outboard radiation phenomena. Likewise, the decision to incorporate spectrograms from Mirnov coils is based on the diagnostic's ability to measure magnetic fluctuations originating from MHD instabilities, which can lead to disruptions. In order to address phenomena characterized by fast temporal dynamics, the inclusion of the locked mode signal was chosen. This signal is commonly employed at JET to trigger mitigation actions. It is integrated into an alarm scheme that employs both AND/OR logic and optimized thresholds, ensuring its effectiveness. The proposed predictor exhibits significant performance, with only one missed alarm out of 92 disrupted discharges and three false alarms out of 131 regularly terminated discharges in the test set.},

  abstract = {Prediction of disruptions from scratch is an ITER-relevant topic. The first operations with the new ITER-like wall constitute a good opportunity to test the development of new predictors from scratch and the related methodologies. These methodologies have been based on the Advanced Predictor Of DISruptions (APODIS) architecture. APODIS is a real-time disruption predictor that is in operation in the JET real-time network. Balanced and unbalanced datasets are used to develop real-time predictors from scratch. The discharges are used in chronological order. Also, different criteria to decide when to re-train a predictor are discussed. The best results are obtained by applying a hybrid method (balanced/unbalanced datasets) for training and with the criterion of re-training after every missed alarm. The predictors are tested off-line with all the discharges (disruptive/non-disruptive) corresponding to the first three JET ITER-like wall campaigns. The results give a success rate of 93.8\% and a false alarm rate of 2.8\%. It should be considered that these results are obtained from models trained with no more than 42 disruptive discharges.}

The database contains 14 diagnostic parameters from the ∼104 discharges (disruptive and non-disruptive). The test set contains 417 disruptive discharges and 999 non-disruptive discharges, which are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The results reveal that the true positive (TP) rate is ∼\,0.827, while the false positive (FP) rate is ∼0.067. This indicates that 72 disruptive discharges and 67 non-disruptive discharges are misclassified in the test set. The FPs are investigated in detail and are found to emerge due to some subtle disturbances in the signals, which lead to misjudgment of the model. Therefore, hundreds of non-disruptive discharges from training set, containing time slices of small disturbances, are artificially added into the training database for retraining the model. The same test set is used to assess the performance of the improved model. The TP rate of the improved model increases up to 0.875, while its FP rate decreases to 0.061. Overall, the proposed data-driven predicted model exhibits immense potential for application in long pulse fusion devices such as ITER.}

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.}

  abstract = {Progress in the area of MHD stability and disruptions, since the publication of the 1999 ITER Physics Basis document (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2137–2664), is reviewed. Recent theoretical and experimental research has made important advances in both understanding and control of MHD stability in tokamak plasmas. Sawteeth are anticipated in the ITER baseline ELMy H-mode scenario, but the tools exist to avoid or control them through localized current drive or fast ion generation. Active control of other MHD instabilities will most likely be also required in ITER. Extrapolation from existing experiments indicates that stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes by highly localized feedback-controlled current drive should be possible in ITER. Resistive wall modes are a key issue for advanced scenarios, but again, existing experiments indicate that these modes can be stabilized by a combination of plasma rotation and direct feedback control with non-axisymmetric coils. Reduction of error fields is a requirement for avoiding non-rotating magnetic island formation and for maintaining plasma rotation to help stabilize resistive wall modes. Recent experiments have shown the feasibility of reducing error fields to an acceptable level by means of non-axisymmetric coils, possibly controlled by feedback. The MHD stability limits associated with advanced scenarios are becoming well understood theoretically, and can be extended by tailoring of the pressure and current density profiles as well as by other techniques mentioned here. There have been significant advances also in the control of disruptions, most notably by injection of massive quantities of gas, leading to reduced halo current fractions and a larger fraction of the total thermal and magnetic energy dissipated by radiation. These advances in disruption control are supported by the development of means to predict impending disruption, most notably using neural networks. In addition to these advances in means to control or ameliorate the consequences of MHD instabilities, there has been significant progress in improving physics understanding and modelling. This progress has been in areas including the mechanisms governing NTM growth and seeding, in understanding the damping controlling RWM stability and in modelling RWM feedback schemes. For disruptions there has been continued progress on the instability mechanisms that underlie various classes of disruption, on the detailed modelling of halo currents and forces and in refining predictions of quench rates and disruption power loads. Overall the studies reviewed in this chapter demonstrate that MHD instabilities can be controlled, avoided or ameliorated to the extent that they should not compromise ITER operation, though they will necessarily impose a range of constraints.}

Two types of plasma disruptive discharges have  been investigated for similar equilibrium parameters: one with a distinct stage  of a small central temperature collapse ([Formula: see text] 5-10\%) around 1  millisecond before the thermal quench (TQ), while the other without. For both  types, the TQ phase is preceded by a rotating 2/1 tearing mode, and it is the  development of the cold bubble from the inner region of the 2/1 island O-point  along with its inward convection that causes the massive energy loss. In  addition, the micro-scale turbulence, including magnetic fluctuations and density  fluctuations, increases before the small collapse, and more significantly towards  the TQ. Also, temperature fluctuations measured by electron cyclotron emission  imaging enhances dramatically at the reconnection site and expand into the island  when approaching the small collapse and TQ, and the expansion is more significant  close to the TQ. The observed turbulence enhancement near the X-point cannot be  fully interpreted by the linear stability analysis by GENE. Evidences suggest  that nonlinear effects, such as the reduction of local [Formula: see text] shear  and turbulence spreading, may play an important role in governing turbulence  enhancement and expansion. These results imply that the turbulence and its  interaction with the island facilitate the stochasticity of the magnetic flux and  formation of the cold bubble, and hence, the plasma disruption.},

  abstract = {The fusion triple product depends on density, which is therefore a key parameter for the future fusion reactor. In this paper the high density limit is studied in the reversed field experiment (RFX-mod) device in Padova, Italy. A rather complete experimental picture of the high density regimes is provided, showing a series of features, such as, plasma flow inversion in the edge, density accumulation, radiation condensation (poloidally symmetric and toroidal asymmetric) which resemble the MARFE phenomenon characteristic of tokamak discharges. However, in RFX-mod high density does not cause a disruption, as often observed in tokamaks, but a soft landing of the plasma current. According to a new 1D transport/radiative code applied to analyze the high density discharges, the current decay is due to an increased need for dynamo in these highly resistive, edge-cooled discharges. The relation between the radiative pattern of RFX-mod high density plasmas, the magnetic topology, and edge radial electric field is discussed.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to Support Vector Machines and related kernel methods.In the 1990s, a new type of learning algorithm was developed, based on results from statistical learning theory: the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of SVMs—-kernels—for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics.Learning with Kernels provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years.},
